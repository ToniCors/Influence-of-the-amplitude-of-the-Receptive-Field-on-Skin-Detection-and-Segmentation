# Influence-of-the-amplitude-of-the-Receptive-Field-on-Skin-Detection-and-Segmentation

Skin detection is the starting point for skin segmentation,that can be useful in a variety of contexts, such as face recognition, hand gesture analysis and naked people detection. Many papers on skin detection focus on algorithms that work on a single pixel: in this paper we investigate how the number of contiguous pixels analyzed at once can impact the performances of skin detection and segmentation.

To train and test our model we used the ECU dataset (Phung et al., 2005) http://www.uow.edu.au/~phung/download.html (currently not available).
